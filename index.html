    <ul>
        <li><h4>Describe the nature of your product and list the marketplace needs that you are trying to satisfy.</h4></li>
        <p>The nature of our product comes down to connecting experts to clients who are in need of expert advice on their career. The marketplace needs we are trying to satisfy are those of young adults, particularly college students, who are increasingly thinking more of their career choices in life. Although adults with or without a college degree are not excluded from our target market either.</p>
        <li><h4>Explain how your products and services meet these needs.<h4/></li>
        <p>Our products and services meet these needs through one-on-one conversations in a scheduled series of sessions where the client learns about the skills needed to gain, types of experiences needed, how to be job ready, places to volunteer for experience, what classes to take in college, and so much more. By the end of the client's time of using of our product, he/she will have had a detailed action plan that will propel them to a successful career.</p>
        <li><h4>List the specific consumers, organizations or businesses that your product serves or will serve.<h4/></li>
        <p>Consumers - Any person from the range of college students to working adults(with/without college degree) who is in need of advice and a plan for their future/current career choices. High school students are a possible target market for the future. Organizations/Businesses - Companies that are heavily involved and connected to/with colleges and educational organizations. A few examples would be book publishing companies, tutor services, job search websites/services, and education establishments.</p>
        <li><h4>Explain the competitive advantages that you believe will make your product a success such as your location, expert personnel, efficient operations, or ability to bring value to your customers.<h4/></li>
        <p>Our competetive advantages include the following:
            -Using computers and/or phones as a medium for communication and connection worldwide, resulting in a flexible scheduling time frame.
            -Allowing for clients to have a personal one-to-one experience with our expert vendors who have the background, knowledge, experience, and networks in the corresponding field of study.
            -Operations of service are ideally through video calls over the internet. Otherwise, a talk over the phone would be sufficient.</p>
